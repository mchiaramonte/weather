This project is for my RPI weather station. The weather station uses a Pimoroni eInk Display:

And a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It pulls the weather from our local weather station so we can see if it's a nice day to go to the beach :-)

The pi is setup to pull the latest code on startup so I can push updates easily.
